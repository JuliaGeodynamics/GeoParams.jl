# Zircon age parameterizations

## Methods
Zircons are one of the ways in which we can date the age & activity of magmatic systems.
Here, we provide a computational routine that computes the zircon age distribution from temperature-time paths

GeoParams.ZirconAgeData
```

## Computational routines
There is one main routine with which you can compute zircon age probability density functions from a range of temperature-ime paths:

```@docs
GeoParams.compute_zircon_age_PDF
```

This, in turn, calls two other routines:
```@docs
GeoParams.compute_zircons_Ttpath
GeoParams.zircon_age_PDF
```

We also provide a plotting routine, provided the GLMakie.jl package is loaded, which produces figures such as:
